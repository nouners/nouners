#### LLM Tools

This repo includes an `AI-CONTEXT.md` file with project-specific guidelines for AI coding assistants. Point your LLM tools to this file for better context and code consistency.

For tools expecting specific filenames, consider creating a symlink (e.g., `ln -s AI-CONTEXT.md TOOL_SPECIFIC_FILENAME`).
